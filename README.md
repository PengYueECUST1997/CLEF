# CLEF
Contrastive Learning of language Embedding and biological Feature is a contrastive learning framework used to combine information from supplemental biological features or experimental data with protein language model [ESM-2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) generated embeddings. Generated cross-modal feature can be used for better downstream protein prediction like Gram-negative bacterial effectors prediction or virulence factors discovery.
